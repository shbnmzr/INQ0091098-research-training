    "## Terms and Definitions\n",
    "**Genomics**: focuses on studying the entire genetic material () of a *single organism*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metagenomics**: focuses on studying the genetic material from *multiple organisms* found in a mixed sample\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phage (Bacteriophage)**: specifically infects and replicates within bacteria. Phages play a key role in controlling bacterial populations in nature and can influence microbial ecosystems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)**: the process by which an organism transfers genetics material to another organism that is not its offspring\n",
    "* Why is HGT important?\n",
    "⋅⋅* Spread of antibiotic resistance: bacteria can pass genes that confer resistance to antibiotics, even across species, making infections harder to treat\n",
    "⋅⋅* Evolution and adaptation: HGT allows for rapid evolution, enabling organisms to quickly acquire traits that help them survive in new environments or under changing conditions \n",
    "* How is HGT done?\n",
    "⋅⋅* Transduction: transfer of DNA between bacteria by viruses (phages)\n",
    "⋅⋅* Conjugation: transfer of DNA through direct contact between 2 cells. **Plasmids** are small, circular DNA molecules that exist independently of a bacterial chromosome. A bacterium with a plasmid transfers it to another bacterium via a physical connection, called Pilus.\n",
    "⋅⋅* Transformation: uptake of free DNA from the environment by a cell. **Microeukaryotes** may release or uptake free DNA in such a way \n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical Gene Transfer (VGT)**: the process by which genes are transferred from parent to offspring through reproduction"
